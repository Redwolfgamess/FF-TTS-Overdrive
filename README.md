## 🛡️ Is This Cheating?

> ❗ TL;DR: **No, it's not cheating in casual play**.

The Overdrive Tool is an **external app** that:
- Does **not** modify game files.
- Does **not** automate gameplay or input.
- Only gives **audio guidance** — just like a friend in a voice call would.

### 🚫 It *would* be considered cheating if:
- Used in a **competitive tournament**.
- **Epic Games** releases an official **competitive mode** and disallows third-party tools.

While the tool doesn’t break Fortnite’s current Terms of Service, **Epic Games has the final say** on what’s allowed.

---

## ⚠️ What This Tool *Cannot* Do

- ❌ Add custom note skins — Fortnite strictly prohibits modding.
- ❌ Detect which song is playing automatically.
- ❌ Change Fortnite’s visuals or modify files — doing so may trigger **Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC)**.

---

## 🎮 Controller Player Info

> This applies to **PC players using controllers** (not console players).

Currently, Fortnite Festival doesn’t support native controller input for external tools. As a workaround:

- Use [JoyToKey](https://joytokey.net/en/) to convert controller button presses into keyboard keys.
- Then, assign that key in the Overdrive Tool settings.
